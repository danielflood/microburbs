# Dan's Microburb test submission
Thanks for reviewing my submission.

My first two attmepts are in `house_orientation.py` and `house_orientation_v2.py`

However, since my test I realised I made a huge mistake by starting with a satellite image rather than the address of the house. I realised it's easier to get the location of the house and the nearest road by starting from the address and then querying open maps. 

As a result I improved my solution and you can find that in `improved_orientation.py`
